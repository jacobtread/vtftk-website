## 


<Card title="VTFTK" icon="open-book">
	Create items that can be thrown at you, sounds that can be played, and trigger VTube studio. All using events from twitch such as redeems, commands, subscriptions, follows, raids, bits

	Still early stages and work in progress, but it does work and throwables / sounds can be created then triggered by events.

	Aiming to be a tailored and improved version of [KBonk](https://github.com/typeou/karasubonk) more suited to my needs and wants.
</Card>	


<CardGrid >
	<Card title="Custom Commands" icon="pencil">
		Write custom commands using JavaScript powered by `deno_core`.  Build in editor running on 
		[Monaco](https://microsoft.github.io/monaco-editor/) providing great editing experience and 
		type hinting for the APIs.
	</Card>	
	<Card title="Scripting" icon="pencil">
Subscribe and react to various events using the same JavaScript code powered by the same editor as Custom Commands.
	</Card>
	<Card title="Events" icon="add-document">
		React to stream events such as channel point redeems, follows, subscriptions etc and 
		perform actions such as throwing items, playing sounds, and triggering VTube Studio hotkeys
	</Card>
	<Card title="TTS Monster Integration" icon="setting">
		Integrated with [TTS Monster](https://tts.monster/) to use AI generated text to speech voices. Currently only available through the scripting API
	</Card>
	<Card title="Low resource usage" icon="open-book">
		The **VTFTK** app is built with Rust for its core logic and uses SQLite for data storage, ensuring a low memory footprint. 
		While the web-based UI can increase resource usage, closing the app's window reduces this by running it in the background as a server. The Webview can be reopened or the app fully exited via the tray menu icon.
	</Card>
	<Card title="Built-in assets" icon="open-book">
		Collection of built in pre-configured throwable items from [Pixel Mart](https://ghostpixxells.itch.io/pixel-mart) Sounds sourced from [KBonk](https://github.com/typeou/karasubonk) which is originally sourced from 
		[Game Audio GDC](https://sonniss.com/gameaudiogdc) from the [Hong Kong Action Kit Hit Kit 1](http://www.sonniss.com/sound-effects/hong-kong-action-kit-hit-kit-1/)
