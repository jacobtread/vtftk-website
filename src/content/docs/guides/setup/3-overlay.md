The OBS overlay is required to play sounds and for seeing the thrown items. The guide below shows you how 
to connect it.


Open **VTFTK** and visit the "Home" tab, in the "Active Overlay" section press the "Copy Link" button or manually copy the URL.

This is the link to the overlay to add to OBS

You can optionally enable "Shutdown source when not visible" and "Refresh browser when scene becomes active" 

"Shutdown source when not visible" will allow you to save resources by hiding the overlay browser when you hide it or are on a different scene that doesn't have it
